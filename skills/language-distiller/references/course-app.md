# Course study app and listening episodes

Use this when several units have reviewed sheets and the learner wants to study on the phone, listen on the go, practise with flashcards or play. Both deliverables are rendered from the same reviewed lesson records and sheets. They never change the sheets.

## course.json

Write one `course.json` (usually in `_work/`). Paths are relative to the file.

```json
{
  "title": "Deutsch B1.1",
  "subtitle": "Lektion 1–12 · Wortschatz · Grammatik · Redemittel · Geschichte",
  "narration": "narration.json",
  "voices": {"de": "de-DE-KatjaNeural", "en": "en-US-AvaNeural"},
  "cache": "audio",
  "episodes_dir": "../Audio",
  "new_per_day": 20,
  "private_terms": ["Menschen B1", "Hueber"],
  "units": [
    {"id": "L01", "label": "Lektion 1", "lesson": "L01/L01_Lesson_v2.json", "sheet": "../L01_Studysheet_v2.html"}
  ]
}
```

List units in course order. Use the newest reviewed sheet of each unit; drafts are refused. `new_per_day` sets the trainer's default for new cards per day (20 suits most learners; 25 suits a near exam date). `voices` and `narration` are optional; the voices shown are the defaults. Other keys are refused, so a misspelt key (`episodes_out` for `episodes_dir`) cannot silently fall back to a default folder.

**Name the course yourself, never after the source.** The title, subtitle, unit labels and lesson titles are spoken in the episodes and shown in the app. `private_terms` lists names that must never appear in the app or the episode names: the course book's distinctive title words, its publisher, the teacher. The tools refuse to write output that contains one.

## Pronunciation: the target language is always spoken by its own voice

German is the example below. Another language uses its profile's voice, word lists and dictionary in the same way ([languages.md](languages.md)); `course.json` may still set `voices`. All units of a course share one target language, and the app's own texts are German for a German course and English for any other.

Multilingual neural voices guess the language of each request, and the Edge service marks every request as American English. Short German words inside English ("als", "rund", "total") then come out with English pronunciation. `scripts/speech.py` therefore never asks one voice to speak both languages:

- German text (headwords, examples, frames, variants, story sentences) goes to the German voice in one piece.
- English text (glosses, use cues, explanations) is split into language runs, and German words inside it go to the German voice. Detection uses:
  - word lists, plus the German and English `pyspellchecker` dictionaries and their word frequencies;
  - capitalisation, and an article before a capitalised word (`die Babysitter`);
  - hyphenated compounds (`S-Bahn`);
  - the neighbouring words.

  It also reads course-book notation: `A:` and `CH:` (Austrian and Swiss variants), `etw.`, `jdn.`, `(e)`, `→` and `…sten`.
- Forms lines (`abschließen = to complete`) are German notes; the side right of `=` is read as an English gloss.
- Each run is synthesized on its own. The clip trims each run's built-in silence and pauses by punctuation, so it sounds like one speaker.

Before synthesizing, read the `plan` output and spot-check `<cache>/plan.json`, where `texts` shows every clip as `[de] …` and `[en] …` runs. Fix a mis-split note in the lesson data, not in the audio.

## Spoken grammar explanations (narration.json)

Without narration, `🔊 Erklärung` reads the grammar card itself: title, meaning, rule, patterns and contrast. That is correct, but it sounds like a list. For natural audio, write `narration.json` next to `course.json`, keyed by unit id and grammar id:

```json
{"L01": {"g01": "Use «als» for one single moment in the past, or for one period of your life. For example: «Als ich ein Kind war, hatten wir einen Hund.» After «als», the verb goes to the very end …"}}
```

Write each point as a short spoken explanation:

- **Length and order:** 50–110 words of plain, conversational English, in this order: what it is for, the rule, one or two examples, the usual trap.
- **Marks:** mark every German word, phrase or sentence with «…». Marked text goes to the German voice and nothing is guessed.
- **No symbols:** leave out `+`, `→` and `/`, and isolated endings. Show German through short phrases (say «am größten», not "-sten").
- **No wrong German aloud:** describe the mistake instead of saying it, because learners copy what they hear.
- **Original examples:** quote the sheet's own examples or new ones, never the source's.

`plan` refuses narration for unknown unit or grammar ids, and lists unmarked words that look German.

## Audio commands

`course_audio.py plan` works offline. It writes `<cache>/plan.json` with each unit's listening order, the German controls (headwords, examples, phrases, variants, story sentences), the grammar explanation chain and the episode announcements, and reports how many clips are not yet in `<cache>/clips`. Clip ids depend on the voices, the spoken runs and their pauses. Unchanged clips are never synthesized twice, and runs shared by several clips are fetched once.

`course_audio.py synth --confirm-external-tts` sends the missing texts to the Edge TTS service. Ask first and say what is sent: the example sentences, glosses, explanations and stories of the selected units, nothing else.

`course_audio.py episodes` builds one MP3 per unit in `episodes_dir`, in the sheet's listening order:

- vocabulary: headword, English meaning, forms, German example, English translation;
- grammar: the spoken explanation, then its examples;
- Redemittel: frame, use and examples;
- Geschichte: the story, read straight through with a breath after each paragraph.

After every German teaching item there is a pause about as long as the clip, so the learner can repeat it aloud (shadowing). Expect roughly 15–30 minutes per unit.

`course_audio.py episodes --kind examples --repeat 2` builds a second set in `episodes_dir/Beispiele`: only the unit's example sentences, each German sentence played twice with a pause to repeat it, then its English meaning. These are the commuting drill: short, dense and made for repetition with the screen off.

Requirements: `pip install edge-tts pyspellchecker imageio-ffmpeg` (or a system ffmpeg).

## App

`build_course_app.py --course course.json --output <Name>_Studienpaket_vN.html` (or `--no-audio`).

**Lernen**
- All reviewed sheets in course order, a unit picker with ‹ ›, and a search over all cards.
- 🔊 on every German headword, example, phrase and variant. **A tap repeats**: by default the clip plays again and again, with a short pause, until the learner taps it again or presses ⏹. The listening panel switches this to 1× or 3×.
- `🔊 Erklärung` on each grammar point plays its spoken explanation once.
- The **Geschichte** at the end of each unit: a **🔊 Ganze Geschichte** button on the story header to play the whole story straight through, a 🔊 per paragraph, and a tap on any sentence repeats that sentence. A tap on an underlined word shows its meaning and speaks it.
- **🎧 Anhören** opens a small panel in the unit's header:
  - **▶ Weiter** (once a session was stopped): goes on where it stopped;
  - three ways to listen: **Ganze Lektion** (German vocabulary and expressions, grammar explained, then the story), **Nur Beispiele** (only the German example sentences) and **Geschichte**;
  - **Jeder Satz 1× · 2× · 3× · 5×**: how often each German sentence is played before the next one;
  - **Am Ende Einmal · ⟳ Endlos**: stop at the end, or start the unit again;
  - **🔊-Taste 1× · 3× · ∞**: what a single 🔊 tap does.

  The session is joined on the device into one continuous audio track with lock-screen and headphone controls (⏯ ⏮ ⏭), so playback continues when the phone screen turns off; when the screen is on, the current card or sentence is highlighted and scrolled into view. A bar at the bottom shows what is playing, with ⏮ (this sentence again; right at its start, the one before), ⏸ / ▶ (pause, then go on in the same sentence), ⏭ (the next sentence now) and ✕ (end). A 🔊 tap during a session pauses it and plays that clip; when the clip stops, the session waits, paused, in the bar. Settings changed during a session apply at once, and all settings are remembered.

  Pauses separate without dragging: before the same sentence again about 0.8 s after a word and 1.35 s after a sentence; before the next one about 1.5–2 s after an example, less after headwords and story sentences, more at the end of a paragraph. They are measured from the voice: each clip's own lead-in and tail are trimmed when the track is built.

**Üben**
- One card per sheet card. Vocabulary goes German → English, with English → German optional. Grammar shows its title and asks for the rule and examples. Redemittel show the situation and meaning in English and ask for the German frame, because that is the choice the learner makes while speaking or writing.
- A card takes one tap, and ✓ Gewusst and ✗ Nochmal are visible from the start:
  - **✓** (or swipe right, →, 2): known, and the next card appears. The answer of the card just passed stays below for a few seconds with "Rückgängig" (or Backspace), in case the learner was wrong.
  - **✗** (or swipe left, ←, 1): the answer opens, and "Weiter ›" (or a swipe, or Enter) moves on.
  - **Tapping the card** (or Space) only peeks at the answer.
- A double tap never grades the next card.
- Rounds of 10 cards with a short break screen. A daily summary offers "+10 neue Karten". The progress bar and streak survive reloads.
- Schedule: new cards in course order up to the daily limit, interleaved with due reviews. "Gewusst" moves a card through the intervals 1 → 3 → 7 → 14 → 30 → 60 days. "Nochmal" brings it back after three cards and restarts its interval.
- Settings live in a closed panel: units, parts, direction, new cards per day, round size, browse mode, sound and a progress backup file.

**Spielen**: for days without motivation. Five short games per unit, made automatically from the unit's reviewed cards, so they never show anything the sheet does not teach and never show wrong German. Every round has exactly one right answer, and the build checks that:

- **🎱 Hör-Bingo.** A card of 4–9 lesson words. A sentence is played (without sound: shown with a gap); the learner taps a word of the card that it contains, or "Nicht auf meiner Karte". The build lists, for every example, the other words of the unit it contains: their lemma, the forms the lesson marks for them and near forms (*verpasse* for *verpassen*), without small words such as *sich* or *an*. The game calls only a sentence that holds no other word of the card, and a tap on any word of the card that the sentence really holds counts as right. A right answer moves on by itself; a wrong one shows the sentence, its meaning and the right word until the learner taps *Weiter*. A line is a BINGO. Trains listening for known words in new sentences.
- **🃏 Wortpaare.** Up to three rounds of five German words (with their article colours) and their meanings, all different within a round; tap a word, then its meaning. A German word speaks when tapped. Time and mistakes give the stars.
- **🧩 Satzbau.** The English meaning is shown; the learner taps the German words in the right order. Only plain sentences of 5–9 words are used: no colons, quotes, brackets or dashes, so there is one clear order and nothing but words to place. A wrong tile only shakes, and after two misses the right one glows. Trains word order, the heart of B1 grammar.
- **⚡ Der · Die · Das** (the article game: its buttons and title are the profile's articles, *El · La* for Spanish; a language without articles has no article game). Sixty seconds of the unit's nouns; streaks multiply the points, a miss comes back soon, and the end screen lists the articles to remember. A noun with two correct articles accepts both: an adjective noun whose forms show «ein Bekannter» (der/die Bekannte), or forms that name both (der or das Joghurt).
- **💬 Was sagt man?** A situation and three phrases from the lesson; the two wrong ones come from other groups and never repeat the right one's words. Pick the one that fits, then hear it and see it in use.

A tap is ignored for 0.3 s after a new question appears, so a tap meant for the last question never answers the next one. `scripts/check_games.js` checks a built app the way a learner's thumb would: it plays every game with double taps and taps right after a question changes, and reports a right answer shown as wrong, a Hör-Bingo sentence with two words of the card, a Satzbau sentence outside 5–9 words, two equal meanings in a Wortpaare round and an option shown twice. `node scripts/inspect_games.mjs <chrome> <app.html> [L01,L02]` runs it in headless Chrome at phone size. "🎲 Überrasch mich" starts a random one. Stars and records are kept per unit and go into the progress backup. Sound effects follow the Ton setting.

## Size and performance

German clips are embedded at 32 kbit/s and the English explanations at 24 kbit/s. They sit in per-unit text blocks after the app script, so the app becomes usable before the audio has finished loading, and a unit's sounds are unpacked on first use. A 16-unit course is about 40–45 MB.

Measured with headless Chrome at 4× CPU slowdown on a 41 MB, 16-unit course: usable after about 3 s, fully loaded after 5–7 s. On a desktop it is about 1 s. For quick sharing or old phones, also build a `--no-audio` copy (about 2 MB) and hand over the MP3 episodes.

## Delivery notes

- **Sending it:** messengers and cloud drives handle the file; most mail servers reject 40 MB.
- **Android:** opens the file in Chrome with everything working.
- **iPhone:** the Files and messenger preview shows the text but runs no JavaScript, so audio, practice and games need a hosted link.
- **Screen off:** each listening session is joined into one continuous audio track with lock-screen and headphone controls (⏯ ⏮ ⏭), so playback continues with the screen off. The MP3 episodes also work in any music player.
- **Progress:** stays in one browser on one device. The backup button moves it between devices.

## Verify before delivery

1. Run the unit tests (`python -m unittest` in `scripts/`; the speech tests need `pyspellchecker`).
2. Open the app in a phone-sized browser at 360–430 px wide and check there is no horizontal scroll.
3. Check the practice flow:
   - ✓ moves on and offers undo, ✗ opens the answer, and a tap only peeks;
   - swipes grade in both directions;
   - the round break and the daily summary appear;
   - progress survives a reload.
4. Check the listening: a 🔊 tap repeats until tapped again; the panel starts all three modes; the bottom bar stops them. Listen to one mixed clip: the German words in it must sound German. Test with the sound muted when other people are around.
5. Play one round of each game to its end screen.
6. Fully decode one MP3 episode with ffmpeg, so that `-v error` prints nothing.
