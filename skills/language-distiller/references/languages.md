# Language profiles

Everything the skill does is the same for every language, except what is in the language's profile, `languages/<code>.json`. The lesson's `target_language` (`de`, `de-DE`, `es` …) picks it; a course needs one language for all its units. The scripts refuse a language without a profile and say which ones exist.

- **German (`de.json`)** is the reference. Every rule of this skill was built and tested with German.
- **Spanish (`es.json`)** has a complete two-unit sample course, `examples/sample-course-es` in the skill's repository (sheets and app, built with `make_sample.py`), reviewed by its author but not yet by a native speaker.

## What a profile holds

| Key | What it is | German |
|---|---|---|
| `code`, `name`, `native` | the language code, its English name (used in labels such as "Play German example" and "Build the Spanish sentence") and its own name | `de`, German, Deutsch |
| `voice` | the neural voice for the target language | `de-DE-KatjaNeural` |
| `sections` | the sheet's section names, also spoken as section titles: `vocabulary`, `grammar`, `redemittel`, `story` | Wortschatz, Grammatik, Redemittel, Geschichte |
| `translation` | the label that unfolds a story paragraph's translation | Übersetzung |
| `articles` | the articles a noun card can carry; `[]` for a language without articles (then nouns need none and the app has no article game) | der, die, das |
| `article_colours` | the colour each article borrows: `der` (blue), `die` (red) or `das` (green) | der → der … |
| `adjective_nouns` | German only: «ein Bekannter» in a noun's forms means the article game accepts der and die | true |
| `noun_plural` | optional, default true: noun forms must say the plural (set false for a language without plurals) | (true) |
| `first_person` | the word whose overuse at the start of examples the review flags | ich |
| `verb_hint` | optional: a pattern the forms of every verb card should match, and the review note when one does not | the Perfekt (`hat/ist`) |
| `ui` | the app's texts: `"de"` keeps the built-in German texts, `"en"` gives English (`UI_EN` in `scripts/language.py`), or a table of German text → your text | `"de"` |
| `bingo` | `function_words`: small words that never count as a lesson word in Hör-Bingo; `verb_endings`: endings a verb's near forms are found by (erinnern → erinnert) | sich, an, hat …; en, rn, ln |
| `speech` | how text is split and read (below) | |

`speech` holds:

- `spellchecker`: the `pyspellchecker` language (es, fr, it, pt, nl, ru, ar, lv, eu and more), or `null`. Without one, only the word lists and «…» marks decide which words are the target language.
- `letters`, `upper`, `lower`: the language's letters as regex classes (`A-Za-zÄÖÜäöüß`).
- `special`: letters English never has, which make a word the target language at once (`äöüß`, `ñ á é`).
- `words`: common words of the language, `ambiguous`: words it shares with English (German *die, an, so*), `articles`: articles and determiners that pull the next capitalised word into the language, `lone`: words that count as the language even alone (German *die*).
- `speakable`: how notation is read aloud (`→` "wird zu", `z. B.` "zum Beispiel"), in order.
- `german_notation`: German only: regional labels (A:, CH:), Konjunktiv II and optional letters (schütt(e)le).

## Adding a language

1. Copy `es.json` (or `de.json`) to `languages/<code>.json` and fill in every key: section names a teacher of the language would use, the articles and their colours, a voice from `edge-tts --list-voices`, the spellchecker code, the letters, common and shared words, the small words for Hör-Bingo, and how symbols are read aloud.
2. Decide the grammar focus for examples, the way German shows the Perfekt on every verb card, and add it to `verb_hint` and to the review.
3. Build one real lesson end to end, from inventory to sheet, app and a few audio clips (only with the learner's approval for hosted speech). Have a speaker of the language review the examples, the story and how the voice reads them.
4. Add a test like `test_language.py` builds for Spanish, then call the language supported.

What stays the same for every language: the selection rules, the data contract, the story rules, the originality check, the listening engine, the games and the app.

## Limits

It works for languages written left to right with spaces between words. Right-to-left scripts (Arabic, Hebrew) and languages without spaces (Chinese, Japanese, Thai) need more work first: the sheet has no right-to-left layout, and Satzbau and Hör-Bingo split sentences at spaces. A profile could add both later: a `direction` for the sheet and a word splitter for the games.

## What the learner sees

- The sheet: the profile's section names, articles in the profile's colours, `<html lang>` from the code.
- The app: a German course keeps the German texts (Lernen, Üben, Spielen, Anhören …). Any other course shows English texts, because a learner of a new language cannot always read its words yet; a profile with its own `ui` table can change that. Section names, the story label and the article game's title (*Der · Die · Das*, *El · La*) always come from the profile.
- The audio: the target language spoken by its own voice, English by an English voice.
